                            <p> My friend has a disability and he’s messaged them saying he was going to attend one of their events. They’ve given him a free ticket, designated parking right outside and a guided tour when he gets there. Awesome that they’re looking after Alright I am flying to London meeting up with an old friend of mine, and we we really want to have an amazing weekend. What are your recommendations concerning night clubs. Best regards. Hi all, recently moved to London and got tix for the Bakermat/Magician show at Printworks on March 8. Have never been to Printworks before and was curious about when openers usually take the stage, as I'm mostly going to see The Magician. Doors are at 20:00 and close is at 2:00. I read some reviews mentioning the queue can be up to an hour long, but I also don't want to go too early and waste money on overpriced drinks. Thanks in advance 
I was wondering on how commonplace or legal this is. A couple of weeks ago a friend of mine got us guestlist entry into Printworks. Now I've heard a lot of bad things about the staff at this place, so wouldn't have paid, but I went anyway. And what do you know, on the way in I was asked to do a pat down search. Fair enough, greeted the guy in a calm and friendly manner, and he proceded to start full on investigating my dick and balls through my trousers over and over. I started getting annoy. trying to sneak in drink in a hole in the back of my puffer coat, was wondering if they do searches and how intense their searches. Anyone know what the security is like at printworks also who's going playaz the line up is maaaaaaaad. Anyone know if the name on the ticket has to match the name of the entree. 
Whoever just witnessed that 10 hour Adam Beyer set with me today experienced one of the greatest techno sets I've seen in a long time. Shit was off the walls, and this venue is PERFECT. Who cares if it closes at 10pm, it feels like night time once you're inside. It was truly a warehouse rave. Some footage of the chaos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvGh49r0B-o. Just booked my Trip to England! March 28th to April 2nd. I'm coming solo and would love to meet up with some cool people. Most likely going to hit up Printworks and Fabric. Any other smaller venues I should check. Used https://printworkslondon.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Sales-and-Events-Executive.pdf (https://printworkslondon.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Sales-and-Events-Executive.pdf). Hey guys, just wanted to extend a thank you to everyone who caught my opening sets on the Europe tour! It was an absolute pleasure to warm up for Joel in these crazy venues. By far the biggest audiences I’ve played for (which was quite nerve-wracking at times!). I have to say, these were far and away some of the best crowds I’ve seen. You guys really show your appreciation for him out here, and I think that’s awesome. I enjoyed speaking with many of you in person at the shows or via Facebook/. In town for the weekend and watch to catch the rugby today at 2:15. Any pubs/bars that will be showing. 23M, 105kg, experienced with MDMA, Ketamine, Mushrooms, Amphetamines etc. I’ve done 2C-B three times now. First one was on its own with some marijuana and the second was with ketamine and marijuana. The third time was part of a nexus flip. Here are the dosages from each experience listed above: 1) 20mg - oral 2) 25mg - oral (with c. 150-200mg ketamine and marijuana) 3) 12.5mg - oral (with 240mg MDMA) I’m taking again this Saturday at a house music rave in London. I’ll be taking it alone. Thought I’d give some opinions on last nights Printworks show and a vague tracklist on the train home for anyone who is interested I won’t say much about the venue as most people are probably aware of the hype around Printworks. Safe to it is an insane venue for anyone who hasn’t been Amy Wiles played deep stuff for an hour. I was really looking forward to Trance Wax and left feeling I wanted more. I thought he would pick the crowd up, but it kind of stayed quite Edit: Tickets now gone! Hope you enjoy the movie :) Very short notice, but there are three tickets for the above going spare due to a team afternoon out being sidelined by this morning's events (long story, and probably sackable to be talking about any way). If you want them, they're yours, just ping me a PM and I'll send you the code you'll need to collect them. No point them going to waste if someone 
Please and thank. Anyone from London that is aware if Printworks will continue having events? Searched everywhere for what is upcoming and couldn t find anything. Thanks. Not sure where else to post this, mods, so bear with me. Due to a shift in work schedules I find myself in the "greater London area" --my quote-- just before this re-textured "multi-venue, multi-sensory" event -- their quote. I'm busy up through the morning of the 28th but I'm considering heading into London proper for an evening (or two) of various shows. Immediately following that I'll be headed back over the pond for more work shit, likely painfully walking through various airports. "I'll. </p>
